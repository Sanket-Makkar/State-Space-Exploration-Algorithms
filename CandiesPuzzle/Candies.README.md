Just a few brief notes about this submission:
1) CandiesPuzzle.ipynb is the notebook I used for this assignment. Executing the first cell gets you all the code you need, and executing the second cell will allow you to execute the plots needed for part c.
2) This requires you to have matplotlib installed (pip install matplotlib if you don't have it should fix everything)
